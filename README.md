# City Evolution Simulation

## Overview

This project implements a simple AI agent designed to manage a city simulation using reinforcement learning techniques. The agent interacts with a grid that represents various city zones (residential, commercial, industrial, green spaces) and adapts its strategies to optimize city growth while minimizing environmental impact.

## Objectives

- Understand and apply AI foundations in a practical scenario.
- Design and implement a reinforcement learning agent using TensorFlow and Pygame for visualization.

## Features

- Visual representation of city evolution with color-coded zones.
- An AI agent utilizing Deep Q-Learning to make decisions based on city metrics.
- Real-time statistics display for city metrics.

## Getting Started
